This plugin will highlight keywords you specify on the admin moderation page, making it easier to spot manual spam and/or troll comments. It will also highlight duplicate comments that people spam on multiple pages.


== Description ==
If your blog gets so many comments you tend to skim them during moderation, you can sometimes miss 'manual spam' or trollish comments. This plugin will highlight keywords you specify so certain remarks grab your attention for further review. It is useful for blogs that get numerous comments and the moderator tends to skim instead of reading each and every one.

== Installation ==
Install the plugin through the WordPress admin and visit the Settings page to set keywords.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Why do I need this plugin if I have a spam filter?

A: This plugin is for real comments with keywords that may or may not be spam
depending on their context, so they are highlighted to help ensure they do not miss your attention.
